I recently graduated in Economics (master's level) from the London School of Economics. My
undergraduate was in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi (a
very reputed institute in India). Having taken math and computer science courses during my
undergrad and monetary economics and econometrics during my master's, I have an excellent
quantitative background. Here is a list of relevant courses I took: Undergraduate - linear algebra,
calculus, probability, and stochastic processes; data structures, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
and database management; Master - monetary economics, econometrics, fixed income securities
(audit). I have extensive programming experience, including Python, SQL, and C++. I also have one
year of experience as a Data Science Intern at three different organisations. Please refer to my CV for
details. Within economics, my interest lies in macroeconomic research and fixed-income markets. Going
forward, I wish to build my career at the intersection of finance and technology, leveraging
state-of-the-art algorithms in ML and AI.
